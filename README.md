Circular Slider UI Control for Android

This repository contains source code for the circular slider control
on Android OS (should work on all devices 2.3+). It works similarly
to the regular slider control (SeekBar), just goes in circle - simple
enough :)

To use it, check the docs or the wiki page on the repo home.
